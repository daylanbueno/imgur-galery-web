## Requirement
Implement a simple web app that
allows browsing the Imgur gallery

### Feature
- show gallery images in a grid
of thumbnails;
- show image description in the
thumbnail, top or bottom;
- allow selecting the gallery
section: hot, top, user;
- allow specifying window and
sort parameters;


#### About the process.
- I created an Imgur account to get security credentials.
- I created an interceptor to include authorization in calls.
- I created a component to render the images.
- Creating a dashboard component
- For this challenge, there was no need to use Redux

### Tecnologies
- ReactJS
- JavaScript
- Axios
- HTML
- CSS
- react-router-dom

## How to run this project

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://0.0.0.0:3000](http://0.0.0.0:3000) to view it in your browser.

### Why not use localhost:3000
- Because requests made by localhost will be protected by Imgur.
