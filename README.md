This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How to run this project

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://0.0.0.0:3000](http://0.0.0.0:3000) to view it in your browser.

### Why not use localhost:3000
- Because requests made by localhost will be protected by Imgur.
